# TimeControl

Simple monitor to control consumed time of an app installed on windows.

Just download the repo and go to Installer folder. Run Install.cmd as administrator and voila. You can reach the app with your pc or your mobile. Just browse with chrome/firefox/edge etc to <pc ip address>:8123

Note there is no security control at this moment!

Talk/Explain carefully to the people affected before implementing this.
